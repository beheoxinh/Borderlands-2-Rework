Unpacked MOD pack summarize interesting things from reborn, UCP, and so much single mod versions from the directory on github BLCMods. I was delete some things and add rework some to complete and balance everything added.

NO Need adding anything else. 
 - Borderlands2.exe was hex changed for 200 slots inventory, max lvl 72, enable console
 - Added autoexec from c0dycode https://github.com/c0dycode/BL-AutoexecDLL
 
 Targeting and new gameplay:
- Reduce boredom and no longer a farming game only, now the game ami to shoot and killing, reducing the RPG that makes you spend too much time, instead enjoying the action.
- Do not change the stats of weapons and skill trees so as not to lose the original of the game (there are only a few minor changes to correct the errors of glitch damage)
- Instead of 3 times of completing the main sequence, you should start with level 1 UVHM save file you can download it from this mod https://www.nexusmods.com/borderlands2/mods/56.
- Greatly increase the drop rate and open treasure chests for good items. The system of venders and dials also increases the amount of good weapons... you will surprise you with a large percentage.
- Balancing the whole system of damage in the game, it will be balanced and reasonable throughout the process from level 1 UVHM to level 72 OP8. Balancing everything until OP8, for example, pyscho is no longer easily killed by teammates, melee, deathtrap, turret, and many other skills that are not useless at high levels, normal mobs in OP no longer too tanky and strongth
- Turn off the badass system from players, instead default 20% for all attribute ~(274 tokens / 14), fix most glitch errors in the game. (gaige, pyscho, gunzerker, zer0 damage glitch, Axton move speed glitch, badass glitch...)
- Increment ammo cap, grenade cap, inventory cap, faster gameplay and easy to play...
- Optimize a lot of things in the game, collect on githud folder and some things I want to create...
- You will maximize the skill tree when you up to level 72, the item's selling price is adjusted accordingly, customizing the parameters so that there are no meaningless or worthless items,  turn off unnecessary effects and optimization to make games smoother. Lots of other things waiting for you to experience....
